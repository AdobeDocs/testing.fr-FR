# Server Side: implement Target{#server-side-implement-target}

Information about Target Server Side delivery APIs, Recommendations APIs, and the NodeJS SDK.

The following table lists the various APIs and the NodeJS SDK and provides additional information:

This is especially valuable for organizations that want to deliver targeting to a non-browser based IoT device, such as a connected TV, kiosk, or in-store digital screen. </p> <p>This endpoint can return offers for ordinary mboxes only.

   <td colname="col2"> <p>The Batch Delivery API lets your application request content for multiple mboxes in a single call. It also has a prefetch mode that enables clients like mobile apps, servers, and so forth to fetch content for multiple mboxes in one request, cache it locally, and later notify Target when the user visits those mboxes. </p> <p>This endpoint can return offers for ordinary mboxes only. Because you can fetch content for multiple mboxes, for performance, it makes more sense to use batch the mbox API. It lets you avoid executing multiple HTTP requests, which can be expensive. </p> </td>

## Differences Between Server Side Delivery APIs and the NodeJS SDK {#section_10336B7934F54CE98E35907A4748A4A4}

Many customers are confused about the differences between the Server Side delivery APIs and the NodeJS SDK. This is especially true when it comes to performance.

The following FAQs should help you decide which to use:

**When should you use "raw" Server Side APIs versus the NodeJS SDK?**

Ideally if you are using NodeJS as your backend technology, NodeJS SDK is a natural choice. The SDK handles a lot of details, such as cookies, headers, payload, and so forth. This lets you focus on the core of your application.

**Should I gain any performance improvements by using the NodeJS SDK?**

Unfortunately, we don't have any performance numbers. However, in general, the NodeJS SDK should good performance, thanks to the NodeJS event-driven architecture. Be aware that most of the time is spent on the Target backend. The NodeJS SDK does very little processing. The SDK is basically responsible for packaging a Target request and parsing a Target response.
