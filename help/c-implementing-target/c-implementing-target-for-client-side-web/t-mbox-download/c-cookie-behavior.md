# mbox.js cookies{#mbox-js-cookies}

The cookie behavior depends on whether it is a first-party cookie, a third-party cookie with a first-party cookie, or a third-party cookie alone.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This topic contains information about `mboxSession` and `mboxPC`. Our implementation best practices recommends that you do not link or store any sensitive information with the cookie data: `mboxSession` or `mboxPC`.

See also [Delete the Target Cookie](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/t_cookie_deleting.html).

## When to Use First- or Third-Party Cookies {#section_F71B29420C004A7FA3B1921E619B326E}

Your site set up determines which cookies you want to use. It is helpful to understand how Target works when trying to understand first and third-party cookies. See [How Adobe Target Works](../../../c-intro/c-how-target-works.md#concept_459AB4DEE7364A9290C2FD405DC29584) for more information.

There are three main use cases for cookies:

1. One domain.

   All of your testing will take place within one top-level domain ( [!DNL `www.domain.com`], [!DNL store.domain.com], [!DNL anysub.domain.com], etc.).

   Approach: Use only first-party cookies. This is the default.

1. Users cross domains and you want to track and test their behavior across these domains.

   Example: A user comes to your site to shop but checks out through Yahoo stores. Three approaches (work with your account representative to determine the best approach):

   * Enable first- and third-party cookies.
   * Enable third-party only (very rare, but has the benefit of keeping the mbox cookie out of your domain).
   * Enable only first-party cookies and pass `mboxSession` parameter when crossing domain.

      The `mboxSession` parameter must be passed to a landing page with [!DNL mbox.js] referenced. It cannot be an intermediate redirector page.

1. You are only using adboxes or Flashboxes on a third-party site.

   Two approaches (work with your client services manager to determine the best approach):

   * Enable first- and third-party cookies.

      First- and third-party cookies are required for Flashbox and dynamic creatives.
   * Enable only third-party cookies.

      This approach is only for the rare case where AdBox implementations are used without on-site targeting.

## First-Party Cookie Behavior {#section_CE6313D979EA4D0897D2F661E7A8AFA7}

The first-party cookie is stored in [!DNL clientdomain.com], where `clientdomain` is your domain.

[!DNL Mbox.js] generates an `mboxSession ID` and stores it in the mbox cookie. The first mbox response contains the offer, as well as the JavaScript to store the `mboxPC ID` generated by the application, in the mbox cookie.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL AMCV_###@AdobeOrg] 1st-party cookie is always set with the Experience Cloud Visitor ID.

## Third-Party Cookie Behavior {#section_4C3A83990BF8415BB1806602D84AED48}

The third-party cookie is stored in [!DNL clientcode.tt.omtrdc.net] and the first-party cookie is stored in [!DNL clientdomain.com], where `clientdomain` is your domain.

[!DNL Mbox.js] generates an `mboxSession ID`. The first location request returns HTTP response headers that attempt to set third-party cookies named `mboxSession` and `mboxPC` and a redirect request is sent back with an extra parameter ( `mboxXDomainCheck=true`).

If the browser accepts third-party cookies, the redirect request includes those cookies, and the offer is returned.

If the browser rejects third-party cookies, the redirect request does not include those cookies, and default content is displayed for all locations on the page. Because there are no cookies set, the same process above happens again on every page request.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL demdex.net] cookie is set if third-party cookies are not blocked.

## Third-Party and First-Party Cookie Behavior {#section_F0C9AD8BFDF8457A999C4A07A0F7A981}

The third-party cookie is stored in [!DNL clientcode.tt.omtrdc.net] and the first-party cookie is stored in [!DNL clientdomain.com], where `clientdomain` is your domain.

[!DNL Mbox.js] generates an `mboxSession ID`. The first location request returns HTTP response headers that attempt to set third-party cookies named `mboxSession` and `mboxPC`, and a redirect request is sent back with an extra parameter ( `mboxXDomainCheck=true`).

If the browser accepts third-party cookies, the redirect request includes those cookies, and the offer is returned.

Some browsers reject third-party cookies. If the third-party cookie is blocked, the first-party cookie still works. Target attempts to set the thrid-party cookie, and if it cannot, then Target can only track on the client's specific domain. Cross-domain tracking does not work if the third-party is blocked, unless the `mboxSession` is appended in the link that crosses domains. In this case, another first-party cookie is set and synched with the prior domain's first-party cookie.

## Cookie Settings {#section_B498B8D1A34A444BBF84CC720EE9D87F}

The cookie has several default settings. You can change these settings if needed, with the exception of the cookie duration. Consult your account representative when changing cookie settings.

**What is Apple's approach?**

From Apple:

"Intelligent Tracking Prevention is a new WebKit feature that reduces cross-site tracking by further limiting cookies and other website data."

"This is what's called cross-site tracking and the cookie used by example-tracker.com is called a third-party cookie. In our testing we found popular websites with over 70 such trackers, all silently collecting data on users."
