# Prepare to implement Target{#prepare-to-implement-target}

There are tasks you should complete and information you should gather when preparing to implement Target.

Following these guidelines and filling out the provided questionnaires will help you implement Target, whether you implement by yourself or work with Adobe Consulting (recommended).

If you are working with an Adobe Consultant, it is not required that you know the information in these documents before implementing Target. However, being familiar with the documents Consulting will create and the questions they will ask can help to speed the pre-implementation process. These documents might be modified in the future.

## Adobe Target Business Request for Information {#section_A345E8D9ED41478A90ABE7703648C06C}

This section contains the Business Request for Information (RFI) document that should be completed by the customer before the Target implementation kick-off call.

The objectives of the Business RFI document are as follows:

* Understand the client's business goals
* Understand the client's optimization goals

## Adobe Target Technical Request for Information {#section_95C4F0A2E4EB423399D24F2B7198F6C5}

This section contains the Technical Request for Information (RFI) document that will help our consulting team develop a Target implementation that will meet the client's business and technical requirements. The questions in this document will uncover any hidden hurdles or obstacles to minimize or eliminate the need to revise the implementation.

The objectives of the technical RFI document are as follows:

* Understand the technical platform and any limitations
* Understand the technical environment as it pertains to people and processes.
