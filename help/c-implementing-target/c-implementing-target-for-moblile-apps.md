# Mobile apps: implement Target{#mobile-apps-implement-target}

Adobe Target helps test, personalize, and optimize mobile app experiences based on user behavior and mobile context. You can deliver interactions that engage and convert through iterative testing as well as rules-based and AI-powered personalization.

For more information about implementing Target on mobile apps, see the new [Adobe Experience Platform SDK for Mobile Apps](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-target) (SDK 5.x).

If you are leveraging the SDK 4.x, see [Target for Mobile Apps](../c-target-mobile-app/c-target-mobile-app.md#concept_80126FF457724DE788CE37264A047559).
