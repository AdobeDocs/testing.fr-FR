To do this, first choose from any of the Analytics companies your account is tied to, and then select the appropriate report suite for the activity. Only report suites that are provisioned to connect to Adobe Target will be available for selection. If you don't see the report suite(s) you expect, first try logging out and logging back in to the Adobe Experience Cloud to try again. If the report suite is still missing from the list, please contact Customer Care. </p> <p>Analytics for Target requires a tracking server to report results correctly. A default tracking server will appear in the Tracking Server field. If you use more than one tracking server, you should check to ensure you include the correct tracking server in this field. See <a href="../../../c-integrating-target-with-mac/a4t/t-analytics-tracking-server.md#task_72077BA7E93C4A65A715A18F32228823" format="dita" scope="local"> Using an Analytics Tracking Server </a> for more information. </p> <p>If a reporting solution is specified in your account settings, the specified solution is used and this setting is not visible. </p> <p> <p>Note:  You cannot change your reporting source after the activity goes live in order to keep reports consistent. </p> </p> </td>

Use this selector to choose the specifics for the success metric. </p> <p>If enabled, the Estimated Value of the Conversion field (not available for the Page Score metrics) provides a value for your goal, but not for other metrics. This value enables Target to calculate an estimated lift in revenue. This field is optional; however, incremental revenue for any non-revenue metric cannot be calculated without it. For all revenue metrics (Revenue per Visitor, Average Order Value, Total Sales, and Orders), the estimate uses Revenue per Visitor. The data type is currency. </p> <p> After reaching the activity goal, a visitor continues to see the activity content, unless that visitor qualifies for a higher priority activity. If the visitor reaches the goal again, it is counted as another conversion. Note that this is different than the default behavior in Target Classic, which counts visitors as new if they see the test again. </p> </td>
