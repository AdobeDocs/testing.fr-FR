# Experience Targeting{#experience-targeting}

Experience Targeting (XT) delivers content to a specific audience based on a set of marketer-defined rules and criteria.

Experience Targeting, including [geotargeting](../../c-target/c-audiences/c-target-rules/c-geo.md#concept_5B4D99DE685348FB877929EE0F942670), is valuable for defining rules that target a specific experience or content to a particular audience. Several rules can be defined in an activity to deliver different content variations to different audiences.

When visitors view your site, Experience Targeting (XT) evaluates them to determine whether they meet the criteria you set. If they meet the criteria, they enter the activity and the experience designed for qualifying audiences is displayed. You can create experiences for multiple audiences within a single activity.

Experience Targeting is a first step into the world of personalization and often begins with A/B testing. A marketer runs an A/B test, and through the use of reporting audiences discovers that different experiences resonate with different audiences. Experience Targeting allows the marketer to easily leverage that discovery and switch to long-term targeting of content to those different user segments.
