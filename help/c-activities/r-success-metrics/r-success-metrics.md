# Success metrics{#success-metrics}

In Target Standard, success metrics are pre-configured for both reporting and tracking purposes.

**Activity Metrics (7:43)**

This videos shows you how to use activity metrics.

* Understand "goal" metrics
* Understand and build Conversion, Revenue, and Engagement metrics
* Build a click-tracking metric

In keeping with the [!DNL Target Standard] goal of simplifying test creation, the application takes care of some of the configuration that was done manually in [!DNL Target Classic]. For example, success metrics are pre-configured with the optimal options.

By default, conversion events are set to "count once and keep the entrant in the activity" in [!DNL Target Standard]. Conversions are counted only once, no repeat conversions are counted, and the visitor always sees the test content.

Revenue metrics that are set to "Increment count and keep the user in the activity" log order details only for the first order made by the same visitor. All subsequent orders increase conversion count, but will not add revenue to RPV/AOV/Sales, and will not be included in the Order Details report.

The following success metrics are available:

   <td colname="col2"> <p>Engagement-based </p> </td>

  </tr>

For engagement-based metrics (unlike for conversion-based and revenue-based metrics), visitors must re-qualify for the activity on each visit in order to increment the count for that session. The associated metric begins incrementing after re-qualification and stops at the end of each visitor's session. A session ends after 30 minutes of inactivity. Therefore, you won't see results immediately during testing, however, all results from that session are available within a few minutes of the session ending.

You can also create custom success metrics.

After selecting the success metric, select the action taken by a visitor to achieve the goal. For example, choose a Conversion metric, set it to be counted once per visitor, then set whether success is achieved when a visitor views a certain page (or set of pages), views a specific mbox, or clicks a specific link.

If enabled, the Estimated Value of one conversion field (not available for the Page Score metrics) provides a value for your goal, but not for other metrics. This value enables [!DNL Target] to calculate an estimated lift in revenue. This field is optional; however, incremental revenue for any non-revenue metric cannot be calculated without it. For all revenue metrics (Revenue per Visitor, Average Order Value, Total Sales, and Orders), the estimate uses Revenue per Visitor. The data type is currency. See [Estimating Lift in Revenue](../../administrating-target/r-target-account-preferences/c-estimating-lift-in-revenue.md#concept_32F875D8F91349CE86AF391F65BEAEEE) for more information.

The success metrics you choose for your activity are available in the report settings when you view a report for the activity.

Some metrics, such as Custom Scoring and Revenue Per Visitor, require a customized implementation that passes in information such as order totals and order IDs.

## Advanced Settings {#section_7CE95A2FA8F5438E936C365A6D43BC5B}

Use the advanced settings to manage how you measure success. Options include counting the metric per impression or once per visitor, and choosing whether to keep the user in the activity or removing them.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you use [!DNL Adobe Analytics] as your reporting source, settings are managed by the [!DNL Analytics] server. The advanced settings option will not be available.

You can also use the advanced settings to create dependent success metrics, incrementing one metric only if a visitor reaches another metric first.

![](assets/UI_dep_success_metric.png)

For example, a test conversion might only be valid if a visitor clicks the offer, or reaches a particular page before converting.

Dependent success metrics are supported in A/B testing, Automated Personalization, Experience Targeting, and Multivariate testing activities. Recommendations activities do not currently support dependent success metrics.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Dependent success metrics will not convert in the following cases:

* If you create a circular dependency in which metric1 is dependent on metric2 and metric2 is dependent on metric1, neither metric can convert.
* Automated Personalization activities release users and restart the activity when conversion metrics are reached, so any metric dependent on the conversion metric will not convert.

Use the advanced settings to determine what happens after a user reaches the goal metric. The following table shows the available options.
