   <td colname="col3"> <p>In an A/B Test, if you look at the test results before the sample size is reached, you risk relying on inaccurate results (you cannot "peek"earlier!). </p> <p>That is because unlike Auto-Allocate, in an A/B test, the traffic distribution remains fixed even after you recognize that some experiences are outperforming others. </p> </td>

   <td colname="col2"> <p>Auto-Allocate reduces the cost of a typical A/B test because it has a higher overall conversion rate than a manual A/B test. The conversion rate is higher because Auto-Allocate pushes more traffic to the highest performing experience, meaning you can realize the benefit of that winning experience earlier than the end of the test period (you can peek!). </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col3"> <p>Auto-Allocate identifies the winner but does not differentiate among the losers. If you need to know how each Experience performed, A/B testing is preferable. </p> <p>The Auto-Allocate feature works with only one advanced metric setting , which is "Increment Count and Keep User in Activity."This means that if you do not want to count repeat conversions, you should use A/B testing instead. </p> <p>Auto- Allocate cannot consume reports in A4T. </p> </td>

   <td colname="col1"> <p>Auto-Target </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>With Auto-Target, machine learning is applied to any kind of experience, including multi-page experiences. It also allows you to gain the value of Automated Personalization while using the familiar A/B testing workflow. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col3"> <p>With Auto-Target, if you want to change the content of your offers often or frequently, the algorithm will need enough time after each change to exploit what it learns and actually deliver that content to the right visitors. </p> <p>Auto Target cannot consume reports in A4T. </p> </td>

   <td colname="col1"> <p>Automated Personalization (AP) </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>With Automated Personalization, you can collect all of your offers in one place, and the algorithm simply figures out the best combination of them. You do not need to specify or build individual experiences. Automated Personalization uses the same machine learning algorithms as Auto-Target. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col3"> <p>When you combine multiple offers, a combinatorial explosion occurs resulting in the need for a significant amount of traffic.

   <td colname="col3"> <p>A Multivariate Test is time consuming , and due to the multiple variables at play, it does not necessarily produce a winning Experience with confidence. </p> <p>It is often challenging to reach the amount of traffic needed to complete the test. Since all Multivariate test experiments are fully factorial, too many changing elements at once can quickly add up to a very large number of possible combinations that must be tested. </p> <p>Even a site with fairly high traffic might have trouble completing a test with more than 25 combinations in a feasible amount of time. </p> </td>
