# Experience Cloud Device Co-op{#experience-cloud-device-co-op}

Information about the Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op, a program that lets participants work together to better identify consumers across digital touch points while ensuring the highest level of privacy and transparency.

The Experience Cloud Device Co-op empowers participating brands to recognize their consumers so they can deliver more personalized experiences across devices and apps at massive scale. The Device Co-op is a core service of the Adobe Experience Cloud. It is available to Adobe customers who use Analytics, Audience Manager, Media Optimizer, or Target. For more information, see the [Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op documentation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcdc/).

In Target, you can use Device Co-op data in A/B tests, Multivariate (MVT) tests, and Experience Targeting activities. The Device Co-op option is available during activity creation on the Goals & Settings page in the Target three-step guided workflow. For more information, see [Target: A/B Tests, Multivariate Tests, and Experience Targeting](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcdc/mcdc-target.html).
