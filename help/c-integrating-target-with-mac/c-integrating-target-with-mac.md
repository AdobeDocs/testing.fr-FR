# Integrate Adobe Target with the Experience Cloud{#integrate-adobe-target-with-the-experience-cloud}

Integrating Adobe Target with Adobe Analytics and other Experience Cloud solutions enables the use of the same data, audiences, and metrics in both solutions.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Currently, you must contact Adobe Consulting to enable integration with Adobe Analytics.

This integration requires both the Adobe Target and Adobe Analytics solutions of the Adobe Experience Cloud. Additional features are available if the Adobe Audience Manager solution is also used.
