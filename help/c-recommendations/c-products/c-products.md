Entities refer to the items you want to recommend. Entities can be anything such as products, content (such as articles, slide shows, images, movies, and tv shows), job listings, restaurants, and so forth.

Recommendations displays items from your collections according to criteria you set up.

Use Entities to:

* Set up your collections
* Use feeds to get entity or content information into your recommendations
* Set exclusions to prevent certain items from displaying in your recommendations
