# Recommendations{#recommendations}

Recommendations activities automatically display products or content that might interest your customers based on previous user activity or other algorithms. Recommendations help direct customers to relevant items they might otherwise not know about.

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL Recommendations] activities are available as part of the [!DNL Target Premium] solution. They are not available in [!DNL Target Standard] without a [!DNL Target Premium] license.

>[!NOTE]

>If you currently have [!DNL Recommendations Classic], see [Recommendations Classic versus Recommendations Activities in Target Premium](../c-recommendations/c-recommendations-faq/c-recommendations-classic-versus-recommendations-activities-target-premium.md#concept_A80223EF66634EA380580C2823A581C5) for more information about the two solutions.

[!DNL Recommendations] helps you optimize and customize real-time suggestions across channels, apps, pages, email messages, and other delivery options to increase engagement and conversion while reducing management effort.

[!DNL Recommendations] helps you:

* Create sophisticated criteria (rules) to automate recommendations
* Automatically display the recommendations by using a few JavaScript snippets
* Test and optimize the recommendations criteria and designs that display the recommendations
* Report on the results of your recommendations activities

The following illustration shows recommendations on a web page:

A recommendation determines how a product is suggested to a customer, depending on that customer's activities on the site. For example:

<table id="table_4753CB411DA247C08C8AC46B0D034879"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Desired Action </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Recommendation </th> 
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Encourage people who purchase a backpack to consider buying hiking shoes and trekking poles. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Create a recommendation that shows items that are often purchased together, using the "People who bought this also bought that" criteria. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Increase the time visitors spend on your media site by recommending media content similar to what they are watching. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Create a recommendation that suggests other videos, using the "People who viewed this viewed that" criteria. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Suggest that customers who viewed information about savings plans at your bank also read about IRA accounts. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Show other products people purchased after viewing one product without showing the first product in the recommendations, using the "people who viewed this also bought" criteria. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
