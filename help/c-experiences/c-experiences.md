# Experiences and offers{#experiences-and-offers}

An experience determines which content displays when the visitor meets the audience criteria for an activity.

An activity typically contains more than one experience. For example, visitors from the Salt Lake City area might see an offer for a $30 discount on ski boots, while visitors from San Diego see an offer for a discount on wet suits. Or, you might test a page with different special offers for returning visitors. Each of these offers is presented in a separate experience.

Target provides the following experience composers:
