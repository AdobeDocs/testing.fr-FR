# Mobile App Visual Experience Composer{#mobile-app-visual-experience-composer}

The Visual Experience Composer (VEC) for Native Mobile Apps lets you create activities and personalize content on native mobile apps in a do-it-yourself fashion without continuous development dependencies and app-release cycles.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Visual Experience Composer for Native Mobile Apps is currently offered as a Beta feature available to select customers to obtain feedback to help us improve the feature before making it available to all customers. Please talk to your Customer Success Manager or Adobe Client Care to participate in this Beta program.

## Overview {#section_C94BC5378FE8440F8C58D96575562EE4}

The existing [Visual Experience Composer](../../c-experiences/c-experiences.md#section_34265986611B4AB8A0E4D6ACC25EF91D) gives you a do-it-yourself capability to create activities and personalize experiences that can be dynamically delivered to your web properties via Target's Global Mbox without any developer intervention. You can now take advantage of the VEC to do the same for native mobile applications. The Mobile VEC can be used to create [A/B Test](../../c-activities/t-test-ab/t-test-ab.md#task_05E33EB15C4D4459B5EAFF90A94A7977) and [Experience Targeting (XT)](../../c-activities/t-experience-target/t-experience-target.md#task_A53DF336CB9F4D7BB87EF2106099EFC4) activities for mobile apps. Support for other activity types will be available in the future.

The Mobile VEC supports the browsers listed in [Target Standard/Premium Interface in Supported Browsers](../../c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/r-supported-browsers.md#reference_01B4BF99E7D545A7998773202A2F6100).

## Target Views & Mobile Applications {#section_9B3941F6EE854F87917611D2A8AF8868}

The Target VEC 2.0 takes advantage of a new concept of Views: a logical group of visual elements that together make up a mobile app experience.

**Introducing Target Views**

Let's consider a shopping app for flowers as an example. The app lets users perform the following tasks:

* List available flowers and bouquets
* View details
* Order flowers
* Control settings, such as payment options and addresses

In this application, each of these tasks can be achieved on a separate screen of the mobile app. As users browse through the app, a screen is rendered allowing them to perform one of the following tasks. If you are an Android developer, you will most likely create four different Android Activity Classes with each class associated with one of these tasks.

In this case, each of these tasks can be considered as Views that your mobile app transitions through. We will refer to these are Target Viewsâ€”each uniquely characterized. A Target View, or View in short, is a logical container of visual elements that are displayed on the mobile screen. Examples of a View is a screen or an Activity Class in Android.

Mobile apps are rarely made this simple. Let's make it a little more realistic. In the first task, which lists available flowers and bouquets, let's add the ability to create multiple layouts and, therefore, different screens. For example, let's add a "Sort By" feature that has three options:

* By Popularity
* Price - Low to High
* Price - High to Low

In this example, whenever a user selects a different "Sort By" option, a new screen displays, even when the Activity Class is the same. Each of these screens can therefore be considered different Target Views.

As a marketer, you're interested in creating different experiences and running distinct offers on each of these views, without asking your developers to set up local mboxes or go through an app release cycle.

## Setting Up the Mobile App {#section_65156B7D335B451D9D98A529D55B9BFC}

Developers must do the following to use the Mobile VEC:

* Depending on your OS:

   * Android - Install the [latest version of Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) on your machine and know how to build applications in it.
   * iOS - Install the [latest version of XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on your machine and know how to build applications on it.

* Have basic knowledge of how to unzip a zipped-compressed file.

For more information and step-by-step instructions, see:

* [Android - Setting Up the Mobile App](../../c-target-mobile-app/c-mobile-visual-experience-composer/c-mobile-visual-experience-composer-android.md#concept_3DD4DC02DCFD45CF91AFC13FFC3BB634)
* [iOS - Setting Up the Mobile App](../../c-target-mobile-app/c-mobile-visual-experience-composer/c-mobile-visual-experience-composer-ios.md#concept_A7B6F56076B049B497262B971A793D4A)

## General Guidelines for Target API Calls {#section_C7276795F02540DCA230AEEDF882A833}

To properly add Target Views for Android, here's a simple table that outlines the correct locations to put the `targetView` calls:

<table id="table_00F3FC8661354120AFA778054DD06964"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Acceptable TargetView Location </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Under the Correct Additions </th> 
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>At the end of <span class="codeph"> Activity::onStart</span>, <span class="codeph"> Activity::onResume</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>It is up to the developer whether to consider <span class="codeph"> OnStart</span> and <span class="codeph"> OnResume</span> to be the same or different <span class="codeph"> targetViews</span>. If the same, use the same <span class="codeph"> viewName</span>. If different, use different <span class="codeph"> viewNames</span>. These events are automatically added by the SDK. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Immediately after an <span class="codeph"> Activity::SetContent</span> call </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>If the UI doesn't change, we can insert a <span class="codeph"> targetView</span> call. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Inside of <span class="codeph"> View::willAppear</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>If the selected view that appears in uniquely in one specific view hierarchy. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Immediately after an <span class="codeph"> Activity::SetContentView</span> call </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>If the activity doesn't change/amend any of its content in the following code. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

For Android, here's a table for incorrect locations to put the `targetView` calls:

<table id="table_CB4A3E940F034A728D783CBE356F9C9F"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Unacceptable TargetView Location </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Reason </th> 
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Within <span class="codeph"> Activity::onCreate</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>The activity has been created, but the view associated with activity is not guaranteed to be complete, and/or attached to the window. This placement might lead to the authoring screen being not sampled or incompletely sampled, and/or the offers being applied in a non-deterministic manner. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Inside of <span class="codeph"> View::didAppear</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>The view has already appeared and the application of the offer will create a poor UI experience with flicker. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Inside of <span class="codeph"> View::didLoad</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>The view is not attached to the main view hierarchy, and might be instantiated, but are not guaranteed to be shown on the app UI. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Using the Visual Experience Composer for Native Mobile Apps {#section_A9FC975468E74FA8AC7CF2B1EFE1B59B}

The following illustration represents the process of using the Mobile VEC:

 </tbody> 
</table>

**Pairing:**

The Mobile VEC connects in real-time to the marketer's mobile app for authoring Target activities. In order to enable that, the first step is to securely pair (authorize) the mobile device and app with Target.

1. While creating an A/B Test activity, for example, select **[!UICONTROL Mobile App]**, select **[!UICONTROL Visual (Default)]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

   ![](assets/mobile-vec-create-1.png)

1. Enter the app's URL, then click **[!UICONTROL Create Deep Link]**.

   ![](assets/mobile-vec-create-2.png)

The pairing process contains the following steps:

1. Enter the app's URL scheme that can be used to generate a deep link. A typical deep link looks like:

   `mymobileapp://path?params`

1. The deep link is available as a QR Code or a URL. The user can scan the QR code from the phone or email/message the URL to him or herself. The deep link URL has an authorization token that is used to securely pair the mobile app and device with Target.
1. Open the deep link URL on your mobile device. This launches the mobile app. The SDK identifies that the app is launched for pairing and authoring in the VEC.

   The SDK makes a request to the Target server and registers itself. The Target server authorizes the token and establish a real-time connection with the device (currently using web sockets).

   After the connection is established, a real-time view of the app appears in the Target Interface. The app has a red boundary overlay that is an indicator that the app is connected to Target, as shown in the illustration below.

   ![](assets/mobile-vec-create-3.png)

   Devices that are already paired can be reconnected by launching the app and opening the authoring interface.

**Authoring:**

After the app is connected and a real-time view of the app appears in the VEC, you can start authoring your activity. At this time the following actions are supported:

<table id="table_25BFAA713B664E5DADF0693A50CEBB34"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Action </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Details </th> 
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Swap Image </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Replace an image in the app with an alternate image. These images will be served via <a href="../../administrating-target/t-scene7-settings.md#task_37AD0768EFBA4E588955FE3D5DD670A5" format="dita" scope="local"> Adobe Scene7</a>. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Change Text </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Change the text content, color, and font-size in a Text element. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

Actions performed in the VEC are visible in real-time in the app, thereby allowing for a real-time preview capability during authoring. Actions are associated with relevant Mobile Screens or Views and are associated appropriately.

## Troubleshooting {#section_625794A4821B4F799933150F652056C5}

**The Mobile VEC says that my app has disconnected.**

Your internet connection might have dropped. Relaunch the application after the internet is available and a fresh connection will be established. We recommend authoring a Mobile VEC activity on a Wifi connection.

**The Mobile VEC is not in sync with my mobile app.**

Click the [!UICONTROL Refresh] button in the VEC to sync the display.

## Delivery {#section_DCBF906097704D519FDF88EEB0720760}

Target activities authored using the Mobile VEC are automatically delivered in mobile apps. These activities are prefetched on app launch and applied as the user navigates through different Target Views, often mapped directly to the screens.

When setting up the Target Mobile Library by calling the `AdobeTargetMobile.attachVisualEditor()` API method, an additional `prefetchOffers` parameter might be provided. When set to "true" (which is also the default), Target offers are fetched from the Target Edge and cached locally, as part of the library initialization process. This allows for a smoother user experience, as Target offers are immediately applied from cache when Target views are triggered with `targetView()` calls, instead of being fetched over the network.

For additional flexibility, the `prefetchOffers` parameter may be set to "false," so that Target offer prefetch can be performed separately from library initialization, by explicitly calling `AdobeTargetMobile.prefetchOffers()`.

`AdobeTargetMobile.prefetchOffers()` can also be called repeatedly as the user navigates a customer app to refresh the local Target offer cache with the most appropriate content (following the latest updates of the current user's Target profile).

Note that each time Target offers are prefetched, the offers for the last Target view triggered with `AdobeTargetMobile.targetView()` are also applied, if possible.

## Known Limitations {#section_DF5148F9CFEB48AF9187F38175D7DEF2}

* Although the normal UI can be targeted with the current implementation, Target View cannot be defined for dialog boxes and alerts. In Android, support for dialog boxes and Alert Target Views will be added into the full release.
* The Mobile VEC can currently be used to create [A/B Test](../../c-activities/t-test-ab/t-test-ab.md#task_05E33EB15C4D4459B5EAFF90A94A7977) and [Experience Targeting](../../c-activities/t-experience-target/t-experience-target.md#task_A53DF336CB9F4D7BB87EF2106099EFC4) (XT) activities for Mobile Apps. Support for other activity types will be available in the future.
* While authoring your activity in the Mobile VEC, currently the Swap Image and Change Text actions are supported. Support for other actions will be available in the future.
* You must close the mobile app from the recent apps section and not by pressing the [!UICONTROL Back] button while trying to reconnect the app to the Mobile VEC.

   If the mobile app is already open during any of the scenarios listed below, you must close the app and then reopen it. However, you *must* close the app by closing it from the recent apps section and *not* by pressing the Back button. There might be intermittent connection issues if the app is closed by pressing the Back button.

   There are several situations in which you must relaunch the app in order to connect to the Mobile VEC if the app is already open:

   * While creating a new activity, after you select the mobile app, the device list dialog box displays. If the app is already open, you must close and then relaunch the app to get its device shown as available for selection.
   * The device dialog box displays when you start editing an activity. If the app is already open, you must close and then relaunch the app to get its device shown as available for selection.
   * The device dialog box displays when you navigate from the "Goals & Settings" step back to the "Authoring" step (Step 1). If the app is already open, you must close and then relaunch the app to connect back to the Mobile VEC.
   Ensure that you close the app by closing it from the recent apps section and not by pressing the [!UICONTROL Back] button. (KB-1714)
