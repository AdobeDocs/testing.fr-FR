User guide directories contain `/assets` subdirectories for image files that are referenced within a directory.

### Markdown file template

For convenience, the root directory of each repository typically contains a Markdown template file named `template.md`. You can use this template file as a "starter file" if you need to create a new article for submission to the repository. The file contains:

- A **metadata header** at the top of the file, delineated by two, 3-hyphen lines. It contains the various tags used for tracking information related to the article. It also includes SEO optimizations and reporting processes that Adobe uses to evaluate the performance of the content. So the metadata is important!
- Various **examples of using Markdown** to format the elements of an article.
- General **instructions on the use of Markdown extensions**, which you can use for various types of alerts.
- Examples of **embedding video** by using an iframe.
- General **instructions on the use of docs.adobe.com extensions**, which you can use for special controls such as buttons and selectors.

A *pull request* provides a convenient way for a contributor to propose a set of changes that will be applied to the default branch. The changes (also known as *commits*) are stored in a contributor's branch, so GitHub can first model the impact of *merging* them into the default branch. zzzz_MOCKED TRANSLATION_zzzz

zzzz_MOCKED TRANSLATION_zzzz We will cover this in detail later, in the [GitHub workflow](local-repo.md) section of this guide.
