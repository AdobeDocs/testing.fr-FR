# System status updates{#system-status-updates}

Use the Adobe System Status page to view the status of Adobe products and Experience Cloud solutions, including Target. This page helps you determine whether problems you might encounter are due to system updates or routine maintenance.

Access the [!UICONTROL System Status] page by going to the following URL:

[https://status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com)

To see the status of Experience Cloud solutions, including Target, click the Experience Cloud tab.

The top of the page contains information about maintenance events in progress and includes a link to subscribe for updates for individual solutions.

In the illustration above, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, and Adobe Campaign were undergoing maintenance updates. All other products and solutions were functioning normally. It is always good practice to check this page if you experience problems when using Target.

An in-product notification always displays during the monthly [!DNL Target] release, but minor updates sometimes occur and are listed on this page.

The bottom of the page contains a calendar of the last seven days with statuses for each solution per day. Hover over a status indicator for more information:
