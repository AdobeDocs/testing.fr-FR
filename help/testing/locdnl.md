# Localization components

## DNL

test

For product names, always use English:

Don&#39;t localize product names like [!DNL Adobe Analytics] or *[!DNL Adobe Photoshop]*

## UICONTROL

Instructions for navigating menus, such as **[!UICONTROL File &gt; Edit &gt; Copy]** should be localized from a database. Same with buttons and other UI items: Press the **[!UICONTROL Enter]** button and observe the [!UICONTROL Confirmation before exit] dialog box.
