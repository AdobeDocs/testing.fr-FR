# Optional - Upload the data file via FTP

If you do not upload using drag-and-drop, you can upload customer attribute data via FTP to the Experience Cloud.

ftp

You can upload the data after you create a customer attribute source and an FTP account in the Experience Cloud. You create one FTP account per attribute source. The uploaded files are stored in the root folder of that account. [!DNL  .csv][!DNL  .fin]
