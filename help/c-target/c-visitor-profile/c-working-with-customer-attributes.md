# Customer attributes{#customer-attributes}

Information about using enterprise customer data from a customer relationship management (CRM) databases for content targeting in Adobe Target by using Customer Attributes in the Adobe Profiles & Audiences core service.

Enterprise customer data collected through multiple sources and stored inside a CRM database can be used in [!DNL Target] to strategically deliver the most relevant content to customers, specifically focusing on returning customers. The [!DNL People] core service (formerly Profiles and Audiences) brings together data collection and analysis with testing and optimization, making data and insights actionable.

## Customer Attributes Overview {#section_B4099971FA4B48598294C56EAE86B45A}

The People core service is part of the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] and provides enterprises a tool to push their customer data to the [!DNL Experience Cloud] platform. Data onboarded to the [!DNL Experience Cloud] is available for all [!DNL Experience Cloud] workflows. [!DNL Adobe Target] utilizes this data for targeting returning customer based on attributes. [!DNL Adobe Analytics] consumes these attributes and they can be used for analysis and segmentation.

Consider the following information as your work with customer attributes and Target:

* There are some prerequisite requirements that you must meet before you can use the [!UICONTROL Customer Attributes] feature in the [!DNL People] core service. For more information, see "Prerequisites for Uploading Customer Attributes" in [Customer Attributes](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/attributes.html) in the *Experience Cloud and Core Services Product Documentation*. Note that [!DNL at.js] (any version) or [!DNL mbox.js] version 58 or later is required.
* Adobe does not guarantee that 100% of customer attribute (visitor profile) data from CRM databases will be onboarded to the Experience Cloud and thus be available for use for targeting in Target. In our current design, there is a possibility that a small percentage of data might not be onboarded.
* The lifetime of customer attributes data imported from the Experience Cloud to Target depends on the lifetime of the visitor profile, which is 14 days by default. For more information, see [Visitor Profile Lifetime](../../c-target/c-visitor-profile/c-visitor-profile-lifetime.md#concept_D9F21B416F1F49159F03036BA2DD54FD).
* If the `vst.*` parameters are the only thing identifying the user, the existing "authenticated" profile will not be fetched as long as `authState` is UNAUTHENTICATED (0). The profile will only come into play if `authState` is changed to UNAUTHENTICATED (1).

   For example, if the `vst.myDataSource.id` parameter is used to identify the user (where `myDataSource` is the data source alias) and there is no MCID or third-party ID, using the parameter `vst.myDataSource.authState=0` won't fetch the profile that might have been created through a Customer Attributes import. If the desired behavior is to fetch the authenticated profile, the `vst.myDataSource.authState` has to have the value of 1 (AUTHENTICATED).

## Customer Attribute Workflow for Target {#section_00DAE94DA9BA41398B6FD170BC7D38A3}

Complete the following steps to use CRM data in [!DNL Target], as illustrated below:

![](assets/crm_workflow.png)

Detailed instructions for completing each of the following tasks can be found in [Create a Customer Attribute Source and Upload the Data File](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/t_crs_usecase.html) in the *Experience Cloud and Core Services Product Documentation*.

1. Create a data file.

   Export customer data from your CRM to CSV format to create a [!DNL .csv] file. Alternately, a zip or gzip file can be created for uploading. Ensure that first row of CSV is the header and all rows (customer data) have the same number of entries.

   ![](assets/CRS_sample.png)

   ![](assets/CRS_CSV_sample.png)

1. Create the attribute source and upload the data file.

   Specify a Name and Description of the data source and the alias Id. The alias Id is a unique ID to be used in your Customer Attribute code in VisitorAPI.js.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The data source name and the attribute name cannot contain a period.

   Data files up to 100 MB can be uploaded using the HTTP method. Files larger than 100 MB, up to 4 GB can be uploaded through FTP.

   * **HTTPS: **You can drag-and-drop the [!DNL .csv] data file or click [!UICONTROL Browse] to upload from your file system.
   * **FTP: **Click on FTP link to [upload file through FTP](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/t_upload_attributes_ftp.html). First step is to provide a password for the Adobe-provided FTP server. Enter the password, then click [!UICONTROL Done].

      Now transfer your CSV/ZIP/GZIP file to the FTP server. Once this file transfer is successful, create a new file with same name and [!DNL .fin] extension. Transfer this empty file to the server. This indicates a End Of Transfer and the Experience Cloud starts to process data file.

1. Validate the schema.

   The validation process lets you map display names and descriptions to uploaded attributes (strings, integers, numbers, and so on). Map each attribute to its correct data type, display name, and description.

   Click [!UICONTROL Save] after schema validation is complete. The file upload time varies depending on the size.

   ![](assets/SchemaValidate.png)

   ![](assets/upload1.png)

1. Configure subscriptions and activate the attribute source.

   Click **[!UICONTROL Add Subscription]**, then select the solution to subscribe these attributes. [Configuring a subscription](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/subscription.html) sets up the data flow between the Experience Cloud and solutions. Activating the attribute source allows the data to flow to subscribed solutions. The customer records you have uploaded are matched up with incoming ID signals from your website or application.

   ![](assets/solution.png.jpeg)

   ![](assets/activate.PNG)

   While performing this step, be aware of the following limitations:

   * The maximum file size for each upload using the HTTP method is 100 MB.
   * The maximum file size for each upload using the FTP method is 4 GB.
   * The number of attributes allowed to subscribe: 5 for [!DNL Target Standard] and 200 for [!DNL Target Premium].
