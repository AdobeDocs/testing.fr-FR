# Audiences{#audiences}

Target different content and experiences to specific audiences to optimize your web marketing by displaying the right messages to the right people at the right time.

By default, traffic is split evenly between experiences. However, you can specify percentage targets for each experience.

Targets can also be rule-based. A rule-based target is based on information gathered about the visitor, such as the visitor's location, browser, operating system, mobile device, or other data.

If you want to show the same content to everyone, but break out report data by group, use segment filters instead of targeting.

When a visitor lands on a page where you have set up an activity, [!DNL Target] determines whether the visitor qualifies as a member of an audience that has been identified for the activity. If the visitor cannot be identified as a member of a target audience, that visitor is shown default content and is not included in the reports for the activity.

If the visitor is identified as part of a target audience, [!DNL Target] determines which experience to display, based on the criteria established when the activity was created.
