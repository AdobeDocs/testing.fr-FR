## Invite users to Target {#task_3E0817630774431983FAA3D2CB2E75BD}

Administrators add users to [!DNL Target] by inviting them to join.

<!-- 

ov/t_invite-users.xml

 -->

1. Add the new user in the role-specific groups in the Enterprise Dashboard.

   After you add a user, the user receives an invitation email.
1. After the user accepts the invitation and logs in to [!DNL Target], configure the user's permission level on the [!UICONTROL Users] page in [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] ( **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Users]**).

   You will not see the new user listed on the [!UICONTROL Users] page until the user logs in using his or her Adobe Experience Cloud account and then logs in to [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] by clicking the [!DNL Target] card.
